            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Memoir of Mr. <hi>Sydney,</hi> Extraordinary Envoy of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> preſented to my Lords the States-General of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>January, 1679/80.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE ſubſcribed extraordinary Envoy of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> doubts not but your Lordſhips are well informed by the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor you have near His Majeſty, with what aſtoniſhment and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he received the Inſtances made to your Lordſhips by the moſt Chriſtian King to enter into a Defenſive League with him; and ſince the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador by his Memoir preſented yeſterday to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, hath ſo vehemently reiterated the ſame; he cannot forbear to repreſent by expreſs order from his Maſter, that he cannot look on this Alliance other than as a League to be made againſt him, after your Lordſhips had made ſuch difficulty to paſs the Act of Guaranty of the Peace concluded at <hi>Nimmeguen,</hi> to which you were obliged by the two ſolemn Treaties of the 10 <hi>January,</hi> and 26 of <hi>July,</hi> 1678.</p>
               <p>That the King his Maſter cannot comprehend this Alliance to have other proſpect than the ſole defence of <hi>France,</hi> or of this State: The <hi>French</hi> King being in a profound Peace, fearing nothing from the Princes his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and your Lordſhips alſo not having any ſubject to apprehend you may be unquieted by them; ſo that this League can have no other end but to facilitate the means for his reſentment and diſpleaſure conceived from the ſeparate Peace made between his Maſter, and this State in 1674; and the zeal his Majeſty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in obtaining for your Lordſhips and your Allies, a Peace more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous than that concluded at <hi>Nimmeguen,</hi> and to have Guaranted that Peace alſo.</p>
               <p>If your Lordſhips reflect upon the <hi>French</hi> King's Declaration given the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, that he ſhould regard this Guaranty of the Peace, as a League made againſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43791:2"/>him, though ſolemnly ſtipulated by his and your Lordſhips Plenipotentiaries at <hi>Nimmeguen,</hi> you will not be aſtoniſhed at the Reſentments of the <hi>French</hi> King on this occaſion; and my Maſter cannot perſwade himſelf that your Lordſhips who have always expreſſed a deſire to live in good and ſtrict union with Him, will engage your ſelves in an Alliance ſo oppoſite to His Intereſt, to which your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips are no ways obliged, the which will certainly break this Union wholly, and oblige His Majeſty to take other meaſures.</p>

               <p>THE ſubſcribed Envoy Extraordinary of the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> ſeeing by the Memoir which the Embaſſador of <hi>France</hi> preſented yeſterday to your Lordſhips, that he continues by urgent inſtances to induce your Lordſhips to enter into that Defenſive League which the Moſt Chriſtian King propoſed to your Lordſhips ſometime ſince; he finds himſelf obliged by new Orders from the King his Maſter, to renew the Inſtances by him made to your Lordſhips by his Memoir of the 9th Inſtant, That you will not enter into ſuch a Treaty as the King his Maſter cannot take to be other than an Engagement againſt His Majeſty, who pretends not to uſe ſuch Menaces as the Memoirs of the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador are filled with; although the King his Maſter hath more cauſe to complain that your Lordſhips have but even now paſſed the Act of Guaranty, to which your Lordſhips were obliged by two ſuch ſolemn Treaties.

               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>French</hi> King having by his Ambaſſador demanded of the States to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Alliance with him: His Majeſty hath all reaſon to believe that the States would accept of ſo advantageous an offer, and would the ſooner com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat this Alliance.</p>
               <p>In regard they have renewed their Alliances with all the Princes with whom they have been in War.</p>
               <p>And that having made peace with <hi>England,</hi> they have not only renewed their former, but concluded a more ſtrict Alliance than before.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43791:2"/>
               <p>And in the ſame Treaty wherein they made Peace with <hi>Sweden,</hi> they renewed their former Alliances.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King demands but the ſame thing of this State, which if they do not do, his Majeſty will have grounds to believe that the States have particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why they will have no Alliance, nor more ſtrict Friendſhip with him, and then his Majeſty hath juſt reaſon to take his Meaſures upon that Foot.</p>
               <p>And his Majeſty will have the greater reaſon to do ſo, ſeeing the States have Alliances with all the other Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King being the only Prince with whom they have not, nor will not have any; His moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty hath reaſon to perſwade himſelf that all the Alliances the States have with other Princes, are deſigned only to take their Meaſures againſt him the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that ſhall preſent; nor will it at all excuſe them to ſay that the Alliances the States have with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were made during the States being invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in War, ſeeing the Alliance that <hi>France</hi> now propoſeth, conſiſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Engagements, nor contains but the ſame Conditions that were demanded by theſe States <hi>Anno</hi> 1662.</p>
               <p>If in the preſent Conjuncture of affairs they refuſe the renewing the Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> his Majeſty will have no ground to believe that they eſteem the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>France</hi> and the States incompatible, and by conſequence that it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him for ever to take other Meaſures, ſeeing the Eſtates declare to him that they believe it not for their Intereſt ever to allie themſelves with <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any one object, That notwithſtanding this Alliance may be neceſſary and good, yet they ought to remit the concluding of it to another time.</p>
               <p>His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty being ignorant of any thing that can be a reaſon for this delay, he ought to believe that the States not daring abſolutely to refuſe this Alliance, they protract time only with a deſign not to make one.</p>
               <p>And if theſe Reaſons, be they what they will, be not the ſame in ſix Months or a year, that they are at preſent, do not they then by conſequence imply a perpetual obſtacle to the renewing of friendſhip or alliance 'twixt <hi>France</hi> and the States?</p>
               <p>Whether the Complaints that ſome Princes have made of the renewing this alliance, ought to be ſuſpected or not?</p>
               <p>Whether a Prince, be he what he will, can oppoſe himſelf to the States in their making of innocent Alliances, and ſuch as he hath with them himſelf, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it appear at the ſame time, that he will attack the one or the other, or that he hath ſome other hidden deſign?</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> King is ſo far from taking it ill that the States create themſelves new friends and alliances, that he would himſelf procure them for them, if he knew of a Prince with whom they have not already an alliance.</p>
               <p>It is no reaſon to be given for the hindering the Alliance with <hi>France,</hi> to ſay that they will not make a League of <hi>Guarantie</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing that League is as Declarative againſt <hi>France</hi> as the Triple League was.</p>
               <p>That there is no compariſon in making a League of this nature with a Prince with whom they are already allied; and the renewing of an Alliance with one with whom they have none, although formerly they were ever ſtraitly allied.</p>
               <p>Whether it can be ſaid that the States do remain neuter, and not do for one Prince what they have already done for another; as if they would ſtraitly allie themſelves with the one during the War, and refuſe to do ſo with the other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Peace, and yet call it a State of Neutrality.</p>
               <p>For if the Alliances made by the States during the War, hinder them from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Alliance with <hi>France</hi> now; it is ſufficient to make his moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty know, that the ſame Spirit that ruled againſt him, during the War, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues ſtill during the Peace.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:43791:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>And His Majeſty cannot believe that the States are ſincerely returned to him as he hath ſincerely given them his friendſhip, ſeeing they refuſe to give him thoſe marks of affection that he offers them, and that they have at other times ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently wiſhed for.</p>
               <p>If they conſider the foundation of the moſt Chriſtian Kings demand to the States to renew the Alliance, they will find themſelves under a preciſe Obligation to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> Kings Letter of the 18 of <hi>May,</hi> 1678, which the States accepted of, did not contain the Propoſitions of Peace, which were ſo agreeable to them, but under condition to re-enter into the ſame Bonds and Alliances, that they were anciently in with His Majeſty.</p>
               <p>That notwithſtanding the <hi>French</hi> King hath no grounds to fear that his Forces are not ſufficient to defend himſelf againſt all the attempts of thoſe that bear him ill will; yet however, he thinks himſelf obliged to know what the States inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are as to his regard, as he is already ſatisfied of their ill intentions, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the renewing of this Alliance, becauſe they cannot without fear and envy behold the advantages of ſuch an Union.</p>
               <p>It is without good grounds that ſome affirm that the States have never made Alliances, but upon preſſing occaſions, as thoſe were with the ſeveral Princes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the War, and that theſe Alliances ceaſe with the Peace; for thoſe that know better the ſtate of things, are ſatisfied that the Alliance was not propoſed upon any particular account, but at the Inſtances of the States during the Peace; whereas the Alliances made with other Princes continue firm ſince the Wars, ſo that ſome are to continue yet 20 years, others 30 years, and others for ever, whileſt there is not one Prince except <hi>France,</hi> with whom the States will not have an Alliance.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to anſwer thoſe that ſay publickly, that the Alliance with <hi>France</hi> is aſſuredly advantageous; but however, the States ought to be judg of their own time when to make it.</p>
               <p>Upon which 'tis agreed, that if the States would propoſe a new Alliance, it is juſt they ſhould chuſe their own time; but when his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty doth require them to renew the ancient Alliance they had with him, and they do it not, then it may be concluded, that they have reſpects, which they conſider more than the friendſhip of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
               <p>Whereas if one duly conſider this Propoſition in it ſelf, one may ſay they have had more than time enough to determine it, ſince they have diſcourſed of the renewing this Alliance; ſeeing there was a Propoſition of this nature made in <hi>May</hi> laſt by a Miniſter of the Court of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>French</hi> King ought to preſume, that the States are ſo vigilant in their own affairs, and ſo affectionate to him, that they would have reſolved ſince <hi>May</hi> laſt, of what they were to do in this affair; and now that his Ambaſſador came in concluſion to propoſe this Alliance, His Majeſty beholding their ſilence, cannot but doubt of their intentions for him, and demand a Deciſive anſwer, to the end he may once take his due meaſures.</p>
               <p>Nor can the <hi>French</hi> King do otherwiſe than draw an ill conſequence from their denying to renew the Alliance with him, for fear of offending thoſe that without reaſon oppoſe it, and who can have no other deſign than hopes to make an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive League againſt him, do therefore hinder this Defenſive Alliance.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be expected that the <hi>French</hi> King will always wait the States lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to reſolve, nor after ſo many advances of amity made by his Majeſty, but that the States muſt thank themſelves if His Majeſty, ſeeing his Alliance refuſed or neglected, take ſuch meaſures as ſhall not pleaſe them.</p>
